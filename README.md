Config for bash, thux, vim and other goodies
This is specific to my setup on OSX, don't just blindly follow it...

Steps:
 1. Clone this repo in ~/etc:
    $ cd  
    $ git clone https://github.com/brokenn/etc.git 
 2. Link this bashrc
    $ ln -s ~/etc/bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
 3. Install homebrew using ruby command at http://brew.sh
 4. Install tmux 
    $ brew install tmux
 5. Link tmux conf
    $ ln -s ~/etc/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

Set Terminal preferences, Advanced, to report terminal as xterm-256color
